    This method uses rectangles to approximate the area under the curve.
    Rectangle width is determined by the interval of integration.
    The interval of integration is then divided into n smaller intervals of equal lengths as step sizes increase,
    and n rectangles would used to approximate the integral; each smaller rectangle has the width of the smaller interval.
    The rectangle height is the functionâ€™s value at the midpoint of its base.
