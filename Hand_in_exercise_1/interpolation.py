    Choose interpolation method to be cubic spline.
    Natural cubic spline is a piece-wise interpolation method with low-degree polynomials, which will prevent excessive oscillations
    and non-convergence. In this problem, we have nearly a linear log fit and the number of data points is only 5, meaning that the
    degree of polynomials will be low and the interpolation will be relatively accurate.
    The goal of cubic spline interpolation is to get an interpolation formula that is smooth in the first derivative and continuous
    in the second derivative, both within an interval and at its boundaries.
